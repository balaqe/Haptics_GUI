# Git branch management
Main should never be committed to directly for any software feature.
It will also contain the last functional state of the code.

In order to commit to the codebase make a new branch with the following template:
```
feature/feature-name
```
When this is done merge the changes to the unstable branch, which after it has been
thoroughly tested, will be merged into main.
